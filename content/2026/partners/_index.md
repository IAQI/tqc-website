## Call for Sponsors

The TQC conference is one of the leading international events focused on the theoretical foundations of quantum 
information science. Each year, TQC brings together researchers from around the world to share the latest advances 
in quantum algorithms, complexity theory, quantum communication, and cryptographic protocols in the quantum era. 

 

The 2026 edition of TQC will take place in Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada, from August 31 to September 4, 2026, at the 
Delta Hotels by Marriott Sherbrooke Conference Centre. The conference will feature invited talks, contributed 
presentations, and poster sessions, offering a platform for vibrant scientific exchange among academics, students, 
and industry professionals interested in the theoretical aspects of quantum computing and information. 

 

TQC 2026 is seeking sponsors to help make the event a success. Sponsorship provides organizations with visibility 
among a highly specialized audience and demonstrates support for cutting-edge research in quantum information science. 
Sponsors will have the opportunity to showcase their brand through logo placement, promotional materials, and, 
depending on the sponsorship level, on-site presence during the conference. 

 

Sponsorship contributions are essential to support keynote speakers, student travel grants, and initiatives that 
promote diversity and inclusion within the quantum community.
