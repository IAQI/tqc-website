### Getting to Sherbrooke from Montréal

<img src="/images/2026/getting_to_sherbrooke/YUL_to_Delta.png" alt="YUL to Delta Hotel" style="width:600px;"/>

Sherbrooke is located about an hour and a half drive from Montréal when there is no traffic. There is a bus service from Montréal but no train service. To assist you in planning your trip efficiently, here are a couple of resources that might be useful for traveling between Sherbrooke and Montreal.

Keep in mind that we highly encourage you to be __mindful of the environment__ and take public transportation as much as possible.

#### From Montréal airport

As both a gateway to and from Montreal, [Montreal-Trudeau International airport (YUL)](https://www.admtl.com/en) is a hub that serves more than 150 international destinations with more than 19 million passengers annually! As YUL expands, it obtained the prestigious 4-star certification of Skytrax's "World Airport Star Rating" in 2019, for the quality of the service offered to passengers.

* The easiest and cheapest way to get to Sherbrooke is to take the [bus line 747](https://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus-network-and-schedules-enlightened/747-yul-montreal-trudeau-airport-downtown) to go to the __Montréal bus station (Gare d'autocars)__ and then follow the instructions to go from there.

* [Aeroshuttle](https://aeronavette.ca/en/home/) is a shuttle service specializing in your travel needs between the regions of Sherbrooke, Magog/Orford, Bromont, Granby, L’Ange-Gardien, Richelieu and Montreal’s Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport. The shuttle is available from and to the airport, 24/7 and 365 days a year. It works with your flight information to bring you directly to the hotel. The cost is 125$ one way or 175$ return.

* [Taxi navette](https://taxinavette.ca/) offers airport transfer services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

* [Car rental](https://www.admtl.com/en/access/car-rental): Several options are available; you can consult them [here](https://www.admtl.com/en/access/car-rental). Note that we do not recommend this option since it is not environmentally friendly.


#### From Montréal bus station (Gare d'autocars)

* [Limocar](https://limocar.ca/en/home/) is an interurban bus service operated by Transdev Canada that is committed to provide a fast, reliable and punctual transport service. The cost to Sherbrooke Terminus is 50.05$ (or 42.54$ for students) one-way and 90.10$ (or 76.58$ for students) return. Hotel Delta is 4km to the west of the terminus on the main thoroughfare, King Street West at Place des Congrès.

NB: Local buses cost 4$ cash.

<img src="/images/2026/getting_to_sherbrooke/Ottawa_to_Delta.png" alt="Ottawa to Delta Hotel" style="width:600px;"/>

There is also a few possibilities to get to Sherbrooke from Ottawa.

### Entering Canada

#### Electronic Travel Authorization
If you are entering Canada by air, you may need an [Electronic Travel Authorization](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta.html) (eTA) in order to be allowed to fly.

Canadian citizens and permanent residents don't need an eTA, and should travel with their Canadian passport or permanent resident card. U.S. citizens and permanent residents also don't need an eTA, and should travel with their U.S. passport, or their passport and official proof of resident status. French citizens resident in Saint Pierre and Miquelon also don't need an eTA and can travel with only a National Identification Card.

All other travellers will need a passport and either an eTA or Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), depending on their [country of origin](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html).

#### Visa

If you need a visa, you should [apply for it](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html) as soon as possible—no less than six weeks in advance!

After registering for the conference, please request a letter confirming your conference attendance from us, and include it with your visa application. When you request the letter, inform us of your current employment or study status, your full address, your email address, and a brief description of who you are and why you are attending TQC.

You may also be required to provide [biometrics](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/biometrics.html) when applying for the visa.
