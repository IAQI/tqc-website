"""
Derive the list of presenting authors from the registration spreadsheet.

The registration exports list, for each registered person, whether they present a
talk or a poster and the title of it. They arrive in whatever shape the organisers
have to hand -- one spreadsheet per presentation type at first, later a combined
csv of everyone registered so far -- so this script reads them all, sorts their
rows by the kind each declares, matches those titles against the matching
accepted-submission data and writes the union to a `presenters-<year>.yml` data
file mapping each paper id to the name(s) of its presenting author(s), so that
Hugo can render them in bold.

Later exports repeat rows from earlier ones, and sometimes rows of their own, so
identical declarations are read once. Counting a person twice would not merely be
redundant: it defeats the elimination that decides which of several talks someone
actually presents.

Matching is title-first and deliberately conservative: a registrant is only
attached to a paper when their declared title identifies that paper, and their
name is then used solely to pick which author of *that* paper to mark. Rows that
cannot be resolved are reported for human review rather than guessed at, which is
what keeps invited speakers, and people registered for another kind of
presentation, out of the result even when they happen to co-author a submission.
